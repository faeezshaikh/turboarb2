        "Name": "You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls. Usually there are a few calls/second, but once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?" ,

            "Explanation":"Q: Can a global secondary index key be defined on non-unique attributes? Yes. Unlike the primary key on a table, a GSI index does not require the indexed attributes to be unique. Q: Are GSI key attributes required in all items of a DynamoDB table? No. GSIs are sparse indexes. Unlike the requirement of having a primary key, an item in a DynamoDB table does not have to contain any of the GSI keys. If a GSI key has both hash and range elements, and a table item omits either of them, then that item will not be indexed by the corresponding GSI. In such cases, a GSI can be very useful in efficiently locating items that have an uncommon attribute.",

            "Explanation":"Reserved Instances (a.k.a. Reserved Nodes) are appropriate for steady-state production workloads, and offer significant discounts over On-Demand pricing. If you are running EMR in production you should specify an AMI version, Hive version, Pig version, etc. to make sure the version does not change unexpectedly (e.g. when EMR later adds support for a newer version). If your cluster is mission critical, only use Spot instances for task nodes because if the Spot price increases you may lose the instances. In development, use logging and enable debugging to spot and correct errors faster. If you are using GZIP, keep your file size to 1–2 GB because GZIP files cannot be split.

            "Explanation":"The question key part to focus on is “and leverage AWS archival storage and messaging services to minimize cost.” For that the storage that is the lowest cost in the answers is Glacier, in addition, the messaging cost is less for SQS then for SNS if they both exceed 1 million transactions which is free. The only answer that satisfies the above two criteria is answer C. Also, there does not seem to be an urgency in speed of messaging therefore SQS satisfies that need. SNS being more real time delivery mechanism."

SSL could be handled on the EC2 instances only with TCP configured ELB, ELB supports sticky sessions only in HTTP/HTTPS configurations. The way the Elastic Load Balancer does session stickiness is on a HTTP/HTTPS listener is by utilizing an HTTP cookie. If SSL traffic is not terminated on the Elastic Load Balancer and is terminated on the back-end instance, the Elastic Load Balancer has no visibility into the HTTP headers and therefore can not set or read any of the HTTP headers being passed back and forth.",
